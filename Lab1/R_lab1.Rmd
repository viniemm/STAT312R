## Problem 1:
Load the airpoll.txt data set into R using the read.table() function. Note that
column names are included in the file so you have to use the header=T option. Use
the head() function to print a few rows of the data. (4 points)

```{r}
airpoll <- read.table("airpoll.txt", header = TRUE)
print(head(airpoll))
```
## Problem 2:
Use R commands to answer the following questions about the dataset:

### a)
What class is the data object? (2 points)


```{r}
class(airpoll)
```
Ans: data.frame

### b)
How many observations are there in the dataset? (2 points)

```{r}
dim(airpoll)
```
Ans: 60 x 7

### c)
How many variables are there in the dataset? (2 points)
```{r}
names(airpoll)
```
Ans: 7
